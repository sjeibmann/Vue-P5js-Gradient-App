## **Gradient Feature Technical Requirements**  

### **1. Spline Path**  
- The gradient should follow a **spline path** (e.g., Catmull-Rom or Bézier).  
- The spline path should be **editable** by the user:  
   - Users can **add, remove, and adjust nodes**.  
   - Nodes should be draggable using a mouse or touch input.  
   - The spline should dynamically recalculate and redraw when nodes are adjusted.  

---

### **2. Gradient Types**  
- The gradient should support three types:  
   - **Linear** – Gradient follows a straight line between start and end points.  
   - **Radial** – Gradient radiates from a central point outward.  
   - **Shaped** – Gradient follows the defined spline path.  
- Users should be able to **switch gradient types** dynamically without restarting the animation.  

---

### **3. Color Management**  
- Users should be able to define **multiple color stops**:  
   - Each stop should have a configurable **color** and **position** along the gradient path.  
   - The gradient should **auto-update** in real-time when color stops are adjusted.  
- Sliders should control the **blend** between adjacent colors.  
   - Example: A "smoothness" slider to adjust the transition sharpness between colors.  

---

### **4. Animation**  
- The color animation should be able to:  
   - **Start** and **stop** with user controls.  
   - **Cycle through colors** in a loop, maintaining consistent transitions.  
   - Follow the defined spline path during the animation.  
   - Maintain consistent timing regardless of frame rate.  
- Animation timing should be **configurable**:  
   - Speed setting should allow milliseconds or frames-per-second (FPS) input.  
   - Easing options (e.g., linear, ease-in, ease-out) for smooth transitions.  

---

### **5. UI/UX Controls**  
- UI should provide the following:  
   - **Add/Remove nodes** – Button or context menu for adding/removing spline nodes.  
   - **Gradient type selector** – Dropdown or buttons for switching between gradient types.  
   - **Color adjustment** – Color picker for editing color stops.  
   - **Blend slider** – To control transition smoothness.  
   - **Animation controls** – Start/stop buttons, speed input, and cycle mode toggle.  

---

### **6. Performance**  
- The gradient and animation should maintain smooth rendering at **60 FPS**.  
- Memory and performance should scale based on the number of nodes and color stops.  
- GPU acceleration should be enabled where possible to optimize rendering.
