## **Gradient Mesh Feature Technical Requirements**  

### **1. Gradient Mesh Structure**  
- The gradient should be defined as a **mesh of nodes**.  
- The mesh should support a configurable number of **rows and columns**:  
   - Default value: **6 rows** x **4 columns**.  
   - Users can adjust the number of rows and columns dynamically.  
- Nodes should represent **color stops** within the gradient:  
   - Colors should be **blended** between adjacent nodes to create a smooth gradient.  

---

### **2. Node Customization**  
- Each node should be individually editable:  
   - Users can **select a node** and assign it a specific color using a color picker.  
   - Node positions within the mesh should be **draggable** for custom shapes.  
   - The mesh should dynamically recalculate and redraw as nodes are adjusted.  

---

### **3. Mesh Visibility**  
- A **visibility toggle** should allow users to:  
   - Turn the mesh **on** – Display the mesh grid and node handles.  
   - Turn the mesh **off** – Hide the mesh while preserving the gradient.  
- When the mesh is visible, nodes and handles should be clearly distinguishable from the gradient background.  

---

### **4. Animation**  
- The gradient colors should be able to animate through the mesh:  
   - Animation should cycle through the colors of the mesh nodes.  
   - Animation should support **start** and **stop** controls.  
   - Animation speed should be configurable (milliseconds or FPS).  
   - Easing options (e.g., linear, ease-in, ease-out) for smooth transitions.  

---

### **5. Color Blending**  
- Colors should transition smoothly between nodes using a blending algorithm:  
   - Linear interpolation for neighboring nodes.  
   - Adaptive smoothing based on the distance between nodes.  
   - Option to adjust the blending sharpness using a slider.  

---

### **6. UI/UX Controls**  
- UI should provide the following controls:  
   - **Row/Column count** – Input fields to adjust the mesh grid size.  
   - **Select Node** – Tap or click to select a node.  
   - **Color Picker** – Assign a color to the selected node.  
   - **Position Adjustment** – Drag nodes within the mesh grid.  
   - **Visibility Toggle** – Show/hide the mesh grid and node handles.  
   - **Animation Controls** – Start/stop buttons, speed input, and cycle mode toggle.  

---

### **7. Performance**  
- The gradient mesh should maintain smooth rendering at **60 FPS**.  
- Mesh updates and animations should remain responsive even with large grid sizes.  
- GPU acceleration should be enabled to optimize performance.
