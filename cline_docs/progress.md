# Progress: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Phase 2 - P5.js Integration (Completed)

The project has completed Phase 2 (P5.js Integration) with the implementation of the gradient mesh feature. We have successfully integrated P5.js with Vue.js, implemented the mesh gradient rendering, added node selection and customization, and connected the UI controls to the visualization. We have also removed the animation features and UI as requested.

## Known Issues

1. Performance may degrade with large mesh grid sizes (e.g., more than 20x20)
2. Color picker doesn't show the current color of the selected node
3. Node selection can be difficult on mobile devices due to small touch targets
4. WebGL rendering may not be supported on all devices
5. Dragging nodes near the edge of the canvas can be challenging

## Recent Achievements

- Implemented the gradient mesh feature with configurable rows and columns
- Added mesh node selection and color editing functionality
- Implemented draggable node positions for custom gradient shapes
- Added mesh visibility toggle
- Created a new MeshControls component for mesh-specific settings
- Removed the spline feature as requested
- Removed the old linear and radial gradient types, focusing exclusively on the mesh gradient
- Removed animation features and UI as requested
- Updated the UI to reflect these changes
- Optimized mesh rendering with WebGL support
- Improved color interpolation with bilinear interpolation
- Added efficient node lookup with computed grid
- Enhanced node selection and dragging interactions

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Further optimize mesh rendering performance for large grid sizes
2. Improve color interpolation between mesh nodes
