# Progress: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Setup (Completed)

The project has completed Phase 1 (Core Setup). We have initialized the Vue.js project with Vite, installed all required dependencies, set up the project structure, created basic component skeletons, and implemented basic routing. The development server is running, and we're ready to move on to Phase 2 (P5.js Integration) with expanded gradient feature requirements.

## Known Issues

As development has not yet begun, there are no known issues at this time. This section will be updated as development progresses and issues are identified.

## Recent Achievements

- Completed project planning and documentation
- Established memory bank for project tracking
- Defined clear architecture and component structure
- Selected appropriate technology stack
- Initialized Vue.js project with Vite
- Installed all required dependencies
- Set up project structure following best practices
- Created basic component skeletons for all major components
- Implemented basic routing
- Created Pinia stores for gradient and animation state management

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Implement P5.js instance in the GradientCanvas component
2. Set up canvas resizing to be responsive to window size changes
3. Implement animation loop with consistent timing
4. Create gradient rendering with spline path support
5. Begin implementation of different gradient types (linear, radial, shaped)
6. Start designing the spline path editing interface

## Blockers and Challenges

No blockers have been identified at this early stage. Potential challenges that may arise include:

1. Integrating P5.js effectively within Vue's component lifecycle
2. Implementing efficient spline path calculations and rendering
3. Ensuring smooth 60 FPS performance during gradient animations
4. Managing complex state for multiple color stops and gradient types
5. Creating an intuitive UI for spline node editing
6. Implementing GPU acceleration for optimal performance
7. Handling touch interactions for mobile spline editing

These challenges will be addressed as development progresses.
