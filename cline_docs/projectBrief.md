# **Tech Brief: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App**

## **Overview**
This app will use **Vue.js** as the framework to create a dynamic P5.js-based gradient visualization that undulates and animates across the full browser window. A user interface (UI) will allow configuration of gradient color steps and animation timing. The UI will be accessible via a sliding drawer from the right side of the screen.

---

## **Goals**
1. **Full-Screen Gradient Visualization**  
   - Display dynamic gradients that animate smoothly across the screen.  
   - Ensure smooth performance and responsive resizing.  

2. **Dynamic Configuration**  
   - Add or remove gradient color steps dynamically.  
   - Adjust animation timing and smoothness in real-time.  

3. **Simplified UI**  
   - Minimalist interface accessed via a sliding drawer.  
   - Keep UI non-intrusive while allowing real-time control.

## **Tech Stack**
### **Core Frameworks and Libraries**
- **Vue.js** â€“ Main framework for app structure and component management.
- **P5.js** â€“ Graphics library for creating dynamic gradients and animations.
- **Vue Router** â€“ For managing app state and navigation.
- **Pinia** â€“ State management for storing gradient color steps and animation settings.
- **MUI (Material UI)** â€“ Component library for consistent UI design.

### **Optional Libraries**
- **@vueuse/core** â€“ Utility functions for reactive state handling and window resizing.
- **gsap** (GreenSock) â€“ If additional animation control is needed beyond P5.js.  
- **vue3-perfect-scrollbar** â€“ For smooth scrolling inside the drawer (if needed).

## **App Structure**
### **1. Main Components**
| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **App.vue** | Root component, handles routing and app-level state |
| **GradientCanvas.vue** | Renders and animates the gradient using P5.js |
| **Drawer.vue** | UI for configuring color steps and animation timing |

---

### **2. State Management**
- **Pinia Store**:
    - `gradientSteps` â€“ Array of color values.  
    - `animationSpeed` â€“ Controls timing of the gradient animation.  

---

### **3. User Interface**
- **Sliding Drawer**:
    - Opens/closes from the right side of the screen using Vue transitions.  
    - Allows adding/removing colors via color pickers (MUI `ColorPicker`).  
    - Input for setting animation speed (MUI `Slider`).  
    - Use MUI `Drawer` component for styling consistency and smooth animation.  

---

## **Key Features**
### âœ… **Dynamic Gradient Rendering**  
- Use P5.js `createCanvas()` to cover the full window.  
- Generate gradients using `lerpColor()` for smooth color blending.  
- Adjust gradient blending dynamically based on user input.  

### âœ… **Animation**  
- Animate gradient using `frameRate()` and `sin()` or `cos()` for undulating effects.  
- Allow real-time updates to animation speed from the UI.  

### âœ… **Responsive UI**  
- Drawer should open/close using Vue transitions and MUI `Drawer`.  
- Ensure smooth resizing with reactive layout using `@vueuse/core`.  

### âœ… **State Persistence**  
- Store gradient and animation state in Pinia for easy recovery on refresh.  

---

## **Technical Challenges & Solutions**
| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Gradient animation performance | Optimize with `requestAnimationFrame()` and reduce redraws |
| Managing dynamic color steps | Use Pinia state and array reactivity |
| Smooth opening/closing of drawer | Use Vue transitions and MUI drawer |
| Full-screen resizing issues | Use `@vueuse/core` for reactive resizing |

---

## **Development Milestones**
### **Phase 1** â€“ Core Setup (1â€“2 weeks)  
- Install Vue, P5.js, and Pinia  
- Set up canvas with basic gradient rendering  

### **Phase 2** â€“ State and UI (2â€“3 weeks)  
- Build state for color steps and animation speed  
- Create functional drawer with color and timing controls using MUI  

### **Phase 3** â€“ Animation and Optimization (2 weeks)  
- Add undulating animation  
- Optimize performance and responsiveness  

### **Phase 4** â€“ Testing and Deployment (1â€“2 weeks)  
- Cross-browser testing  
- Performance tuning  
- Deploy to production  

---

## **Next Steps**
- Initialize Vue and install dependencies  
- Set up MUI and basic P5.js rendering  
- Build initial UI components
