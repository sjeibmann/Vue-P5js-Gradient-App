# Active Context: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the **initialization phase**. We are setting up the memory bank and preparing to begin development of the Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Project Setup**: Establishing the memory bank and documentation structure
2. **Planning**: Refining the approach for integrating Vue.js with P5.js
3. **Architecture Design**: Determining the optimal component structure and state management approach

## Recent Changes

- Created initial project brief outlining the application goals, tech stack, and structure
- Initialized memory bank documentation to track project progress and decisions
- No code implementation has begun yet

## Next Steps

Based on the project brief, the immediate next steps are:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Initialize Vue.js project with Vue CLI or Vite
   - Install required dependencies (P5.js, Vue Router, Pinia, MUI)
   - Configure development environment

2. **Core Implementation**:
   - Create basic application structure with Vue components
   - Implement P5.js canvas integration
   - Set up state management with Pinia

3. **Feature Development**:
   - Implement basic gradient rendering with P5.js
   - Create sliding drawer UI with MUI
   - Develop color step management interface
   - Implement animation controls

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Being Considered

1. **P5.js Integration Method**:
   - Instance mode vs. global mode for P5.js
   - How to properly integrate P5.js within Vue's component lifecycle
   - Best approach for reactive canvas resizing

2. **State Management Strategy**:
   - Structure of the Pinia store for gradient steps and animation settings
   - Local vs. store state for UI components
   - Persistence strategy for saving user configurations

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - When and how to trigger P5.js redraws based on state changes
   - Strategies to maintain 60fps during animations
   - Efficient color interpolation techniques

4. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Drawer animation smoothness and timing
   - Color picker component selection
   - Mobile-friendly control layout

### Open Questions

1. How to best handle the P5.js canvas resize when the window size changes?
2. What's the most efficient way to implement the undulating animation effect?
3. How to structure the gradient steps in the Pinia store for optimal reactivity?
4. What's the best approach for color interpolation with multiple color steps?

## Current Blockers

- None at this stage, as we are just beginning the project setup
