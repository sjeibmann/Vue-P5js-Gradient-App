# Active Context: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Work Focus

The project has completed **Phase 1 (Core Setup)** and is now moving into **Phase 2 (P5.js Integration)**. The primary focus areas are:

1. **P5.js Integration**: Implementing the P5.js instance in the Vue component lifecycle
2. **Gradient Rendering**: Creating the basic gradient visualization
3. **Animation**: Setting up the animation loop and implementing the undulating effect
4. **Reactivity**: Connecting the P5.js visualization to the Pinia stores

## Recent Changes

- Initialized Vue.js project with Vite
- Installed all required dependencies (P5.js, Vue Router, Pinia, MUI, etc.)
- Set up project structure following best practices
- Created basic component skeletons for all major components:
  - MainView.vue
  - GradientCanvas.vue
  - Drawer.vue
  - ColorControls.vue
  - AnimationControls.vue
- Implemented basic routing
- Created Pinia stores for gradient and animation state management
- Set up the drawer UI and control components

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **P5.js Integration**:
   - Implement P5.js instance in the GradientCanvas component
   - Set up canvas resizing to be responsive to window size changes
   - Implement basic animation loop
   - Create simple gradient rendering

2. **State Connection**:
   - Connect the gradient rendering to the Pinia stores
   - Implement reactivity between UI controls and visualization
   - Add state persistence for user configurations

3. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test the gradient visualization on different screen sizes
   - Optimize performance for smooth animations
   - Refine the UI controls for better user experience

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **P5.js Integration Method**:
   - Using P5.js in instance mode for better encapsulation
   - Creating and destroying P5 instances in sync with Vue component lifecycle
   - Using a dedicated container element for the P5 canvas

2. **State Management Strategy**:
   - Using Pinia for global state management
   - Separating concerns into gradient and animation stores
   - Using Vue's reactivity system to connect stores to components

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - MainView as the container component
   - Separate components for canvas and UI controls
   - Drawer component for the sliding UI panel

### Open Questions

1. What's the most efficient way to implement the undulating animation effect?
2. How to optimize the gradient rendering for better performance?
3. What's the best approach for color interpolation with multiple color steps?
4. How to handle mobile touch interactions for the color controls?

## Current Blockers

- None at this stage, as we have successfully completed Phase 1 and are ready to move on to Phase 2
