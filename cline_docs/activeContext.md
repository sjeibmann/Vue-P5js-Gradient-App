# Active Context: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Work Focus

The project has completed **Phase 1 (Core Setup)** and is now moving into **Phase 2 (P5.js Integration)** with expanded gradient feature requirements. The primary focus areas are:

1. **P5.js Integration**: Implementing the P5.js instance in the Vue component lifecycle
2. **Gradient Rendering**: Creating the advanced gradient visualization with spline path support
3. **Animation**: Setting up the animation loop and implementing color cycling along paths
4. **Reactivity**: Connecting the P5.js visualization to the Pinia stores
5. **Gradient Types**: Implementing linear, radial, and shaped gradient types

## Recent Changes

- Initialized Vue.js project with Vite
- Installed all required dependencies (P5.js, Vue Router, Pinia, MUI, etc.)
- Set up project structure following best practices
- Created basic component skeletons for all major components:
  - MainView.vue
  - GradientCanvas.vue
  - Drawer.vue
  - ColorControls.vue
  - AnimationControls.vue
- Implemented basic routing
- Created Pinia stores for gradient and animation state management
- Set up the drawer UI and control components
- Added detailed gradient feature specification with spline path, multiple gradient types, and enhanced color management requirements

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **P5.js Integration**:
   - Implement P5.js instance in the GradientCanvas component
   - Set up canvas resizing to be responsive to window size changes
   - Implement animation loop with consistent timing
   - Create gradient rendering with spline path support

2. **Gradient Types Implementation**:
   - Implement linear gradient type
   - Implement radial gradient type
   - Implement shaped gradient type (following spline path)
   - Add UI for switching between gradient types

3. **Spline Path Editing**:
   - Implement node creation, deletion, and dragging
   - Create dynamic spline recalculation
   - Add UI for spline path editing

4. **Color Management**:
   - Implement multiple color stops with position control
   - Add color blending with smoothness control
   - Create real-time gradient updates when colors change

5. **State Connection**:
   - Connect the gradient rendering to the Pinia stores
   - Implement reactivity between UI controls and visualization
   - Add state persistence for user configurations

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test the gradient visualization on different screen sizes
   - Optimize performance for 60 FPS animations
   - Refine the UI controls for better user experience

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **P5.js Integration Method**:
   - Using P5.js in instance mode for better encapsulation
   - Creating and destroying P5 instances in sync with Vue component lifecycle
   - Using a dedicated container element for the P5 canvas

2. **State Management Strategy**:
   - Using Pinia for global state management
   - Separating concerns into gradient and animation stores
   - Using Vue's reactivity system to connect stores to components

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - MainView as the container component
   - Separate components for canvas and UI controls
   - Drawer component for the sliding UI panel

4. **Spline Implementation**:
   - Will use Catmull-Rom or BÃ©zier splines for path calculation
   - Implement node-based editing with drag-and-drop support
   - Dynamic recalculation of spline when nodes are adjusted

5. **Gradient Types**:
   - Support for linear, radial, and shaped gradient types
   - Dynamic switching between types without restarting animation

### Open Questions

1. What's the most efficient way to implement color cycling along a spline path?
2. How to optimize the gradient rendering for 60 FPS performance?
3. What's the best approach for color interpolation with multiple color stops?
4. How to handle mobile touch interactions for spline node editing?
5. What's the most efficient way to implement GPU acceleration for gradient rendering?

## Current Blockers

- None at this stage, as we have successfully completed Phase 1 and are ready to move on to Phase 2 with the expanded gradient feature requirements
