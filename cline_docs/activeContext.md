# Active Context: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Current Work Focus

The project has completed **Phase 2 (P5.js Integration)** and has implemented the **Gradient Mesh Feature** as specified in the updated requirements. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Mesh Gradient Implementation**: Implementing a configurable mesh grid for advanced gradient control
2. **Node Customization**: Allowing users to select, color, and position individual nodes in the mesh
3. **Reactivity**: Ensuring all UI controls properly update the visualization

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the gradient mesh feature with configurable rows and columns
- Added mesh node selection and color editing functionality
- Implemented draggable node positions for custom gradient shapes
- Added mesh visibility toggle
- Created a new MeshControls component for mesh-specific settings
- Removed the spline feature as requested
- Removed the old linear and radial gradient types, focusing exclusively on the mesh gradient
- Removed animation features and UI as requested
- Updated the UI to reflect these changes
- Optimized mesh rendering with WebGL support
- Improved color interpolation between mesh nodes
- Added bilinear interpolation for smoother gradients
- Enhanced node selection and dragging interactions

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1. **Mesh Gradient Refinement**:
   - Further optimize the mesh rendering for better performance
   - Add more advanced mesh manipulation options
   - Implement GPU acceleration improvements for complex gradients

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhance the node selection interface
   - Add more intuitive controls for mesh manipulation
   - Implement better visual feedback for selected nodes

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize for 60 FPS on all devices
   - Implement more efficient node lookup and rendering
   - Add advanced GPU acceleration for complex mesh gradients

4. **Mobile Support**:
   - Improve touch interactions for node selection and dragging
   - Optimize the UI for smaller screens
   - Ensure consistent performance on mobile devices

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Mesh Implementation**:
   - Using a grid-based approach with rows and columns
   - Each node has a position, color, and can be individually selected
   - Rendering the mesh using triangles for smooth color blending
   - Using WebGL for hardware acceleration when available

2. **State Management Strategy**:
   - Using Pinia for global state management
   - Storing mesh configuration in the gradient store
   - Using Vue's reactivity system to connect stores to components

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - MainView as the container component
   - GradientCanvas for the P5.js rendering
   - MeshControls for mesh-specific settings
   - ColorControls for color management
   - Drawer component for the sliding UI panel

4. **Event System**:
   - Using a custom event emitter for mesh node color updates
   - Connecting the UI controls to the canvas through events
   - Maintaining reactivity between components

### Open Questions

1. How to optimize the mesh rendering for 60 FPS performance with large grid sizes?
2. What's the best approach for implementing more advanced mesh manipulation options?
3. How to handle mobile touch interactions for precise node selection and dragging?
4. What's the most efficient way to implement GPU acceleration for mesh gradient rendering?

## Current Blockers

- None at this stage, as we have successfully implemented the mesh gradient feature and removed the spline, animation, and old gradient types as requested
