# Product Context: Vue.js + P5.js Gradient Visualization App

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to create a visually engaging, interactive gradient visualization application that demonstrates the powerful combination of Vue.js for UI management and P5.js for creative graphics. The project serves as:

1. A showcase of modern web technologies working together
2. An interactive art piece that users can customize
3. A demonstration of responsive, performance-optimized animation techniques
4. A practical example of component-based architecture with state management

## Problems It Solves

1. **Creative Expression Gap**: Provides an accessible way for users to create and customize beautiful gradient animations without requiring coding knowledge
2. **Technical Integration Challenge**: Demonstrates a clean approach to integrating P5.js (which typically works in global scope) within a component-based Vue.js architecture
3. **Performance Concerns**: Addresses the challenge of maintaining smooth animations while allowing real-time configuration changes
4. **UI/UX Balance**: Solves the problem of providing configuration controls without cluttering the visual experience

## How It Should Work

The application presents a full-screen, animated gradient visualization that responds to user configuration:

1. **Initial Experience**:
   - User arrives at the application and sees a full-screen, smoothly animating gradient
   - A subtle indicator shows that additional controls are available
   - The gradient automatically resizes to fit any screen size

2. **Configuration Flow**:
   - User clicks/taps to open the sliding drawer from the right side
   - The drawer presents intuitive controls for:
     - Adding/removing color steps
     - Selecting colors via color pickers
     - Adjusting animation speed and behavior
   - Changes apply in real-time as the user adjusts settings
   - The drawer can be closed to return to the full-screen experience

3. **State Persistence**:
   - User configurations are saved and persist between sessions
   - The application remembers the last state when reopened

## User Experience Goals

1. **Visually Captivating**: The gradient animation should be smooth, beautiful, and engaging enough to hold attention
2. **Intuitive Interaction**: Controls should be self-explanatory and provide immediate feedback
3. **Performant**: Animations should maintain 60fps even during configuration changes
4. **Responsive**: The experience should adapt seamlessly to any device or screen size
5. **Unobtrusive UI**: The configuration drawer should not detract from the visual experience when closed
6. **Delightful Details**: Small touches like smooth transitions, subtle indicators, and responsive controls should create a polished feel

## Target Audience

1. **Creative Explorers**: Users who enjoy interactive visual experiences
2. **Web Developers**: Those looking to learn integration techniques for Vue.js and P5.js
3. **Digital Artists**: People seeking inspiration or a base for their own creative coding projects
4. **UI/UX Enthusiasts**: Those interested in examples of balancing functionality with visual experience
